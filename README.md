# 🧊 NIS CUBE – NIS2 Compliance Assessment Tool

## 📌 Project Overview

**NIS CUBE** is a web-based tool designed to help organizations **understand and assess their level of compliance with the European NIS2 directive**.

The goal of the project is to **translate complex regulatory requirements into a simple, accessible evaluation**, allowing organizations to identify security gaps and improve their cybersecurity posture.

This project was developed as part of a **Bachelor’s degree (L3) in Computer Science and Applications** at **Université Paris Cité**.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

Many organizations struggle to understand:
- what **NIS2** really requires,
- how compliant they are,
- and what actions they should prioritize.

**NIS CUBE** addresses this by providing:
- a **guided self-assessment**,
- a **clear compliance score**,
- and **actionable recommendations**.

The platform is designed to be usable by **both technical and non-technical users**.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Simple Explanation)

1. The user creates an account and logs in.
2. The platform asks a series of questions based on **NIS2 security objectives**.
3. Each answer contributes to a **scoring system**.
4. The user receives:
   - a **global compliance score**,
   - a breakdown by security objective,
   - and recommendations for improvement.

The results can be reused to **track progress over time**.
